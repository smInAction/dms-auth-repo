## MySQL
## Spring Boot configures Hibernate as the default JPA provider
## Spring Boot-1, the default connection pool was Tomcat, but it has been changed to HikariCP with Spring Boot-2
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dmsdb
    username: ${dmsmysqlusername}
    password: ${dmsmysqlpassword}
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create-drop
      # here, JPA implementation is Hibernate
      # possible values: create(Hibernate first drops existing tables, then creates new tables)
      # create-drop(similar to create, with the addition that Hibernate will drop the database after all operations are completed. Typically used for unit testing)
      # validate(validates whether the tables and columns exist, otherwise it throws an exception)
      # update(the object model created based on the mappings(annotations or XML) is compared with the existing schema, and 
      # then Hibernate updates the schema according to the diff.)
      # update - never deletes the existing tables or columns even if they are no more required by the application
